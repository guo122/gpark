This is a Git-like file management software, but does not save history to reduce disk usage. It is used to help view the changes of files between different hardware, such as saving movies on a mobile hard disk, which can be easily checked which are newly added and copied to the mobile hard disk.

Use file size, time of last data modification, SHA1 to determine whether the file has changed.

## Build and Install

```sh
sh configure.sh
make
make install
```

## Usage

*Just like Git.*

help
```sh
gpark help
```
